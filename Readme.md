## Bakait
------------------------
### An object oriented 2D game-engine in Clojure

#### Object Oriented?
Yes. Bakait is built on top of [CljOS](http://github.com/divs1210/cljos).

#### Try it out
* Fire up your terminal and `cd` to the Bakait folder
* Enter `lein repl` to fire up the Clojure repl
* Enter `(require 'bakait.core-test)`
* Enter `(bakait.core-test/-main 1)`
* Press the left/right arrow-keys to see Bakait in action!

#### Note
* Bakait is still a work-in-progress. There is no collision detection yet.
* Bakait is more-or-less a direct port of the [Kilvish Game Engine](http://github.com/divs1210/kilvish) to Clojure.
